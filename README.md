The Library Management System is a web-based application developed using Java, JDBC, and Servlets to manage basic library operations efficiently. The main goal of this project is to provide a simple and user-friendly system for maintaining book records in a library.

The application allows the librarian to add new books by entering details such as book title, author, and price. These details are stored securely in a ORACLE database using JDBC for database connectivity. The system also provides a view books feature, which retrieves and displays all available books from the database in a structured format.

This project demonstrates the use of MVC architecture, server-side processing with Servlets, and database operations (CRUD – Create and Read) using JDBC. It helps beginners understand how Java web applications interact with databases and how servlets handle client requests and responses.

Overall, the Library Management System serves as a foundational project for learning Java web development and database integration.
